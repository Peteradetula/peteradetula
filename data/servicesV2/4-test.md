### Service overview

Validation is crucial before launch. I test designs with real users to ensure they work as intended, identifying issues early and refining the experience based on actual user behavior. This approach saves development time and ensures your product launches with confidence.

### My testing approach includes

Usability Testing: I conduct moderated and unmoderated testing sessions where users complete real tasks with your product, revealing pain points and areas for improvement.

A/B Testing: I design and analyze tests comparing different design approaches to determine which solutions perform better for your specific goals and users.

Accessibility Testing: I ensure your product works for users with disabilities, testing with assistive technologies and following WCAG guidelines for inclusive design.

### Why work with me

Evidence-Based Decisions: I use real user data to validate design decisions, reducing guesswork and ensuring your product meets actual user needs.

Continuous Improvement: I believe testing is ongoing—I help establish processes for continuous user feedback and iterative improvements post-launch.
