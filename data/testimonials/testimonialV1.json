    "feedback": "I've worked with Peter for around 6 months where he was a UI designer as part of my product team. He was responsive, flexible, and always had a positive attitude. He closely worked with the UX designer in the team to move the concepts into UI design, and worked with the development team to walk them through the designs, and supported them throughout the implementation. He was very supportive to the members of the whole product team, and with his positive attitude and willingness to learn, I am sure he will be very valuable to any team."
