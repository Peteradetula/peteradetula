Shell’s Enterprise Product Trading & Booking (EPTB) platform is a SaaS-based analytics tool used by traders, analysts, and business teams to manage product trading, booking, and logistics. The analytics module provides real-time data insights to support critical decision-making. However, users struggled with complex workflows, data overload, and usability inefficiencies, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights quickly.

### Learn about the project

In 2021, the regulated carbon market reached a value of $851 billion, representing a 164% increase from 2020. This growth was driven by stricter carbon regulations, increased corporate sustainability commitments, and rising carbon prices.

Meanwhile, the voluntary carbon market is projected to grow to 1.5 to 2 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) by 2034. This suggests increasing demand for carbon credits , driven by:

- ✅ More companies aiming for net-zero emissions.
  &nbsp;
- ✅ Growing interest in sustainable investing.
  &nbsp;
- ✅ Advancements in carbon capture technologies.

  Since Shell operates in energy trading, an evolving carbon credit market could impact trading strategies, regulatory compliance, and financial decisions. The EPTB platform could potentially integrate carbon credit analytics to help traders make informed decisions regarding emission-related costs.

A short, fictional profile that represents a key segment of my target audience known as Use persona was created. It includes details like demographics, goals, behaviours, and pain points, helping design teams create solutions that meet real user needs.

An empathy map was created as a simple UX tool that helps teams understand users better by capturing what they say, think, feel, and do. It’s used to visualise the user’s perspective, uncover pain points, and identify opportunities to improve the experience.

### Design and User Testing

This is the phase where concepts are turned into interactive prototypes and then evaluated with real users. The goal is to see how people actually use the product, identify usability issues, and gather feedback to refine the design before final development.
