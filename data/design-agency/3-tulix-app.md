### Learn about the project - project overview

74% of Africans worldwide are willing to share more money with their friends and family if they could have more convenient ways to make payments and manage finances with the people that matter to them. Users are unable to share money on the app with their friends and family for specific needs such as school fees, rent and groceries, etc. without losing visibility over how and where money is used.

The aim of this interview was to find out how kenyans share money, budget and manage finances better.

### Design and User Testing

Based on the research, I came up with a user flow diagram to guide the design. Here is a simplified version of it that outlines the features we agreed upon.

### Creating a Jar

One distinctive functionality of the Tulix app is the opportunity for users to create a Jar. Think of a jar as a separate place where you set aside money for specific uses, whether for yourself or others. With jars, Users can manage their money better and get so much more.
