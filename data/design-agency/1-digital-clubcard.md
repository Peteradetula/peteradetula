### What Drives Me (My Design Philosophy)

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm and curiosity: When tasked with a challenge I go deep into the problem so I can understand the core problem we’re trying to solve. Knowing this helps me make informed decisions and build enthusiasm for creating the best experience

User centered design: As a designer, I believe UX is a key to a successful product, a good looking design is only a piece of art if it is not usable.

Never Stop Iterating: I believe that iteration brings powerful results in design and I try to iterate as much as possible by validating design decisions at different stages of the design process.

Seek Clarity Always: I constantly seek clarity and avoid ambiguity when presented with design challenges, I ensure that information is clearly conveyed to users and actions are intuitive.

### Learn About The Project

When customers lose or damage their Clubcard, they order a replacement plastic card. In Q2 2021, there were 191k visits to the order page via the button on the registration page. After changes were made, Q4 showed around 76k visits from the registration confirmation page instead.

The problem: Too many customers are ordering replacement physical Clubcards due to cards being lost or damaged. This creates extra operational costs, delays for customers receiving their cards, and increased plastic usage. It may also indicate that customers are unaware of digital alternatives or that the replacement process is too easy to trigger without exploring other solutions.

The Goal:

### Understanding The User

I asked some helpful questions using the 4W1H principle: How did the problem arise? What was the history? Who are the users and what do you know about these users? Why is this problem important?

Why Reducing Plastic Is Important?
It plays a huge role within the Tesco strategic pillars and core purpose.

I decided to understand the current AS-IS Process to be able to form a strategy and come up with a better solution.

This map helps me deep dive into the three parts of CC users: New joiners, In-life card users and new card requesters

I came up with behavioural family tree that helps explains the how Clubcard is been ordered

Using the continuous discovery approach:

1. ✅ I Interviewed 1-2 customers every week
   &nbsp;
2. ✅ I broke customer insights down into actionable opportunities every week.
   &nbsp;
3. ✅ As a team, we compared and contrast experiments to figure out the best solution in a 30 minutes retro every 2 weeks

Sources of ideas:

1. ✅ User idea: customer interview, analytics, feedbacks from customers, reviews.
   &nbsp;
2. ✅ Team ideas: Workshops, stakeholders meetings, core product team, sales team

I divided users into more refined groups of buyers based on selected characteristics using the following framework:

1. ✅ Demography (Age Group, Education, Gender)
   &nbsp;
2. ✅ Geography (Urban, Rural)
   &nbsp;
3. ✅ Psychography(Personal Attribute)
   &nbsp;
4. ✅ Behavioural Patterns (Buying Behaviour)

Key findings; main insights from research, showing user behaviours, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.

### Ideation/Brainstorming and Prioritisation

I identified key pain points, wants, and needs; generated and connected a wide range of ideas to find potential solutions; defined objectives and categorised findings into codes and themes; synthesised insights using the “How might we” approach; narrowed the options to three high-impact, high-effect ideas; and presented the synthesis to stakeholders.

### Solution, Design, and User Testing

Solution: This translate research insights into practical, user-focused changes that improve both the product and the overall experience.

Sketch The first step on creating the User Interface of Crossremit was to do a hand sketch on paper. This gives the first understanding of how the screens will be before upgrading it to a mid fidelity wireframe

This was after the journey of the users have been concluded. This process made it easier when the proper design started.

User Testing

I created a clickable prototype of the three experiment and tested it with users on a zoom meeting, here are the feedbacks from the test:

1. ✅ Customers find the digital ClubCard scan code and PDF option real interesting, most preferred the digital option.
   &nbsp;
2. ✅ Customers want a physical non-paid option for customers with accessibility issues as the PDF might not be a good option for them.
   &nbsp;
3. ✅ Users requested for a physical non-paid option to customers non-digital shoppers and low income groups.

&nbsp;

After iterating on the three experiments, the team went live with experiment 1(Nudge page optimization and address confirmation) which was the most preferred by the users.

### Design Principles and Impact

Design Principles:

Design for Accesibility: Consider all user groups when creating visual elements for the user interface. Conducted thorough research to understand the needs and challenges of users with disabilities. Consider various disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

Design for efficiency: Understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of users. Design interfaces or products that align with user workflows, making tasks more intuitive and efficient, the goal is to streamline interactions and operations to achieve optimal performance.

Keep it as simple as possible: Ensure that users are not bombarded with more information than they can handle. Optimise with design patterns that users are already familiar with.

Provide Feedback: Provide feedback when users take actions that are contrary to what’s expected and learn from their mistakes to iterate for a better experience.

Business Impact

1. ✅ Percentage of users ordering a plastic ClubCard via web decreased by 60%.
   &nbsp;
2. ✅ Significant reduction in customers calling the CEC to order a plastic Clubcard and a significant reduction in Clubcard & Voucher enquiry calls.
   &nbsp;
3. ✅ Percentage of users installing the app increased by 96% and the visits to the app per test visitor increased by 73%.
   &nbsp;
4. ✅ We managed to reduce plastic Clubcard by 1,448 and based on a 77% value, saving £1, 111, 496.
   &nbsp;
5. ✅ FFFHighlighting the digital app significantly increased the % of users who make a digital scan
