## My Design Philosophy

##### Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm and curiosity

When tasked with a challenge I go deep into the problem so I can understand the core problem we’re trying to solve. Knowing this helps me make informed decisions and build enthusiasm for creating the best experience

### User centered design

As a designer, I believe UX is a key to a successful product, a good looking design is only a piece of art if it is not usable.

### Never Stop Iterating

I believe that iteration brings powerful results in design and I try to iterate as much as possible by validating design decisions at different stages of the design process.

### Seek Clarity Always

I constantly seek clarity and avoid ambiguity when presented with design challenges, I ensure that information is clearly conveyed to users and actions are intuitive.
