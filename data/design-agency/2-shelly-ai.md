### Learn About The Project - Project Overview

At Shell PLC, knowledge is power—but accessing it has long been a challenge. With a vast, intricate ecosystem spanning engineering, supply chain, legal, HR, and finance, employees constantly seek expert guidance on processes, compliance, and technical documentation. However, with thousands of employees navigating complex workflows daily, finding the right information at the right time can be a frustrating and time-consuming process.

The Challenge: Shell PLC operates across multiple departments, where employees frequently rely on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for guidance on processes, compliance, and technical documentation. However, SME availability is limited, leading to inefficiencies, knowledge silos, and delays in decision-making.

### The Goal: Enterprise Design Thinking at Shell

To guide the design of the Virtual SME at Shell, we adopted the principles of Enterprise Design Thinking—a structured, human-centered approach originally developed by IBM. This framework helped us align diverse stakeholders around a shared vision, accelerate decision-making, and deliver value at scale within Shell’s complex, cross-functional environment.

### Discovery - Understanding Employee Challenges

1. Sponsor Users

   > Key stakeholders from each department served as Sponsor Users, guiding the project with domain-specific insights. Their involvement was critical in identifying pain points, validating ideas, and ensuring the AI assistant reflected real-world needs across Shell's organizational landscape.

2. Playbacks
   > We conducted weekly playbacks with our lead stakeholder and department sponsors to review progress, align on priorities, and iterate on design decisions. These sessions acted as feedback loops—ensuring that we stayed focused on solving the right problems, while adapting quickly to new insights or constraints.

By anchoring the project in Enterprise Design Thinking, we were able to rapidly co-create a solution that not only solved for immediate knowledge access issues, but also laid the foundation for scalable, AI-driven knowledge enablement across Shell.

Key Findings from Interviews
(Based on 36 in-depth conversations across Finance, Legal, HR, and Engineering)

1. Fragmented Knowledge Access

   > “I spend 30–40% of my time searching for internal documents or asking SMEs for guidance.” — Finance
   > “Even if I find the right document, it’s often outdated or doesn’t apply to my region.” — Legal

   &nbsp;

2. Overloaded Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

   > “I get the same questions multiple times a week, but there’s no structured way to share my responses.” — Engineering SME
   > “We have critical knowledge stored in people’s heads, not in an accessible system.” — HR

   &nbsp;

3. Lack of Standardised Processes

   > “Each department has its own way of handling approvals, compliance checks, and technical requests, making cross-team collaboration frustrating.” — Finance
   > “There’s no single source of truth—some people follow old protocols, while others use new systems without proper training.” — Legal

   &nbsp;

4. Compliance & Security Risks
   > “Employees sometimes rely on outdated or unofficial workarounds to get things done, which can lead to compliance issues.” — Legal
   > “Some confidential data gets shared via email or chat because there’s no clear, secure alternative.” — HR

Service Blueprint Analysis (Key Pain Points Mapped)

1. Information Retrieval Delays

   > Employees navigate multiple systems (intranet, SharePoint, email threads) to find answers.
   > No centralized search function, leading to wasted time and frustration.

   &nbsp;

2. SME Bottlenecks

   > SMEs answer repetitive questions instead of focusing on high-value work.
   > Knowledge isn’t systematically documented or shared.

   &nbsp;

3. Workflow Silos & Inefficiencies

   > Different departments operate in isolation, leading to duplicated efforts.
   > Employees rely on informal networks rather than structured knowledge-sharing.

   &nbsp;

4. Security & Compliance Gaps
   > Critical data is stored in unregulated channels like personal emails or private chat groups.
   > No clear governance for maintaining up-to-date policies and technical documentation.

A short, fictional profile that represents a key segment of my target audience known as Use persona was created. It includes details like demographics, goals, behaviours, and pain points, helping design teams create solutions that meet real user needs.

![Image 3](/images/shelly-ai-3.png)

Workshop: I also hosted a workshop with stakeholders and key players in both the decision-making and SME spaces. This collaborative session helped us define pain points and map out organizational needs and works to be be done.

### Defining the AI Experience

Key Goals for Virtual SME

1. Personalized AI for Every Department

   > Adaptive AI trained on department-specific knowledge.
   > Role-based access to sensitive information.

   &nbsp;

2. Seamless Knowledge Retrieval

   > Natural language search for internal documentation & compliance policies.
   > Context-aware responses tailored to Shell’s workflows.

   &nbsp;

3. AI-Powered Process Automation

   > Automate routine queries (e.g., approval workflows, expense policies).
   > Integrate with internal systems (SAP, SharePoint, ServiceNow).

4. Security & Compliance by Design
   > Role-based access controls (RBAC) ensure only authorized personnel see certain data.
   > AI explains sources & citations for transparency.

### Design and User testing

We explored different UI approaches, prioritizing:

1. ✔ Conversational Interface – Employees interact naturally, like chatting with an SME.
2. ✔ Quick Actions & Summarization – AI provides direct answers + links to policies.
